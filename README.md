# custom-pgen

## Description

- My motivation for this project was solving and learning an immense amount of new knowledge for Javascript use.
- Through a few different attempts and angles, I was able to create a functioning password generator.

## Link to Application

https://mhammy.github.io/custom-pgen/

## Usage

Click the "Generate Password" button on the page and answer the prompts correctly for the characters you'd like included in your password.

Upon completion of the prompts, you will be displayed a randomized password with your specifics.


## Credits

I am not the original creator of the code used on the application, only a portion of the script.js. The .css and .html files are in the original state given to me by the MSU Bootcamp curriculum.


Huge shout out to WebDevSimplified for showing me a ton of new methods of achieving this project.
